nhancements You Should Add to the EPV Calculator
1. 📉 Add EBIT or Owner Earnings Option
Let the user choose the base input:

Normalized Net Income (default)

EBIT (more stable across capital structures)

Owner Earnings (Buffett’s preferred, if available)

📌 Why: Net income can be distorted by non-cash items, taxes, or capital structure.

Add a dropdown:

[ Net Income | EBIT | Owner Earnings ]
2. 📉 Tax Adjustment Toggle
If using EBIT, you should adjust for taxes:

ini
Copy
Edit
EPV = Normalized EBIT × (1 - tax rate) / cost of capital
📌 Why: EBIT is pre-tax. If left unadjusted, EPV will be overstated.

Add a field:

Tax Rate (%): 21% (default US corp rate)

3. 💰 Maintenance CapEx Input (Optional)
If using Owner Earnings, subtract maintenance capex:

Edit
Owner Earnings = CFO - Maintenance CapEx
📌 Why: It separates true cash generation from growth spending

Let the user input:

Maintenance CapEx ($M)

Or let them check a box: "Estimate maintenance CapEx as % of depreciation" (e.g. 70%)

Earnings Power Value (EPV): $11,111M  
Formula: 1000 / 0.09 = 11,111  
Assumptions:
- Earnings: Net Income
- Cost of Capital: 9%
- No growth, no debt adjustment
5. ⚖️ Debt Adjustment (Optional)
EPV is enterprise value. If you want equity value, subtract net debt:

java
Copy
Edit
Equity EPV = EPV - Net Debt
📌 Why: A company with heavy debt deserves a discount

Add optional input:

Cash: $

Total Debt: $
→ Net Debt = Debt – Cash

6. 🔁 Scenario Toggle
Allow the user to run multiple cost of capital scenarios quickly:

Conservative (10%)

Base (9%)

Optimistic (7%)

📌 Why: Sensitivity range lets you stress test assumptions
