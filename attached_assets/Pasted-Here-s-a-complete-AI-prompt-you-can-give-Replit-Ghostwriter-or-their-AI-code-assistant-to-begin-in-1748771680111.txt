Here‚Äôs a complete AI prompt you can give Replit (Ghostwriter or their AI code assistant) to begin integrating a Global Trade Intelligence Map into your existing Redd web app:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ AI PROMPT FOR REPLIT:

üìå Project Goal:
Add an interactive "Global Trade Intelligence" map page to my existing Redd investment web app. The map should show real-time or static trade flow data for selected commodities (like iron, gold, or microchips) between countries.

üéØ Features:
1. Full-page interactive world map (use Mapbox GL JS or Leaflet)
2. Dropdown to select a commodity:
   - Iron Ore (HS code: 2601)
   - Gold (HS code: 7108)
   - Microchips (HS code: 8542)
3. When a commodity is selected:
   - Shade each country based on export value (from UN Comtrade or public CSV/API)
   - Draw curved trade route lines between countries (width = trade volume)
   - Show popups on hover with key info: trade value, destination, % of world exports
4. Add a year selector (default to latest available data, e.g., 2023)

üì¶ Data Source:
Use sample UN Comtrade export data by HS code in CSV or JSON format for now (mock if needed). Structure:
```json
[
  {
    "exporter": "Australia",
    "importer": "China",
    "commodity": "Iron Ore",
    "value_usd": 54000000000,
    "year": 2023
  },
  ...
]

üß± Tech Stack:
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: React + Mapbox GL JS or D3.js
	‚Ä¢	Backend (optional for future): Pull data from UN Comtrade API or CSV loader
	‚Ä¢	Minimal dependencies (reuse my existing UI styling in the Redd platform)

‚úÖ Output:
One page at /trade-map, showing the trade intelligence visualization with filters.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
	‚Ä¢	The map should be mobile-friendly and default to global zoom
	‚Ä¢	Use mock trade data if the API integration is too heavy for now
	‚Ä¢	Keep code modular so I can later link it to portfolio exposure

üí° Bonus (if time):
	‚Ä¢	Tooltip on top 5 exporters per commodity
	‚Ä¢	Animate trade route arcs over time using a year slider

Let‚Äôs go.

### üîß Notes:
- If you're using **Replit Ghostwriter**, paste the above in a `.md` file or directly into the Ghostwriter prompt panel.
- For testing, I can give you a sample `trade_data.json` file and the `Mapbox` route arc renderer script.

Would you like that file and a `basic trade-map.jsx` component to plug in as well?
